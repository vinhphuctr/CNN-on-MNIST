# CNN-on-MNIST
Apply the Convolutional Neural Networks to classify the MNIST dataset

In my first project with CNN, I built a CNN to classify the MNIST dataset using essentially the Tensorflow library.

The CNN architecture is shown in the Jupyter Notebook.

I trained the model over 5000 times and mostly obtained the accuracy > 95%.
